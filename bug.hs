This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction with infinite lists. The function `findDivisible` intends to find the first number in an infinite list that's divisible by a given number.  However, it might not terminate correctly in all cases due to the way Haskell evaluates expressions.

```haskell
findDivisible :: Integral a => a -> [a] -> Maybe a
findDivisible n xs = listToMaybe (filter (
um -> num `mod` n == 0) xs)

-- Example usage with an infinite list
infiniteList = [1..] 

main = do
  print (findDivisible 7 infiniteList) -- Should print "Just 7"
  print (findDivisible 11 infiniteList) -- Might hang indefinitely, or not return a result
```
